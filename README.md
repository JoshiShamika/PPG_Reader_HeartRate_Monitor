# PPG_Reader_HeartRate_Monitor
PPG Reader and heart rate monitor android application
This project is a sub-part of 'Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as a viable biometric authentication technique'.
It is an android application which records a PPG signal, extracted from a video by placing a finger tip on the camera flash using digital image processing.
The application records the video and process the signal in real time to compute the heart rate of the user.
The recorded PPG video is later used to train the machine learning models(Support Vector Machine (SVM), Local Outlier Factor, and Isolation Forest)
for 'Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as a viable biometric authentication technique'.
